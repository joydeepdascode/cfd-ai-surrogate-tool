# AI Surrogate CFD Tool üöÄ

This is a Streamlit application that serves as an AI-powered surrogate model for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. By training a **Random Forest Regressor** on historical CFD data, the app can quickly predict the Lift ($C\_l$) and Drag ($C\_d$) coefficients for new input parameters, eliminating the need for time-consuming and computationally expensive full-scale simulations.

The app provides a simple, intuitive interface for data scientists, engineers, and students to build and test their own surrogate models.

## Features

  * **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
  * **Model Training:** Train a `RandomForestRegressor` model by uploading a CFD data CSV file.
  * **Dynamic Visualization:** Visualize the selected airfoil and its orientation as you adjust the Angle of Attack.
  * **Quick Predictions:** Get instant predictions for Lift ($C\_l$) and Drag ($C\_d$) coefficients based on the trained model.
  * **Performance Metrics:** View the model's performance with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score after training.
  * **Sample Data:** A "Load Sample Data" button to get started immediately without needing to find a dataset.

## How it Works

The application uses a machine learning approach to **approximate** the results of a complex CFD simulation.

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The app reads a CSV file containing CFD simulation results. The data must include `angle_of_attack`, `reynolds_number`, `Cl`, `Cd`, and `shape_name`.
2.  **Preprocessing:** The airfoil shapes are converted into a numerical format using **one-hot encoding**, allowing the model to understand different geometries.
3.  **Model Training:** A `RandomForestRegressor` model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the relationship between the input parameters (angle of attack, Reynolds number, and shape) and the output coefficients ($C\_l$ and $C\_d$).
4.  **Prediction:** Once trained, the model can take new input parameters and predict the corresponding coefficients almost instantaneously, providing a huge speed-up over traditional CFD.

## Usage

1.  **Upload Data:** Upload your own CFD data in a CSV format. The file must contain the required headers: `angle_of_attack, reynolds_number, Cl, Cd, shape_name`. Alternatively, click the **`Load Sample Data üìä`** button to use the pre-loaded dataset.
2.  **Train Model:** Click the **`‚ú® Train Model`** button. The app will train the machine learning model and display its performance metrics (RMSE).
3.  **Make Predictions:** Use the interactive sliders and the dropdown menu to select a new **Angle of Attack**, **Reynolds Number**, and **Airfoil Name**.
4.  **Visualize:** Click **`üîç Predict Coefficients`** to see the predicted $C\_l$ and $C\_d$ values and a plot showing how the prediction compares to the original training data. The airfoil visualization will also update dynamically as you move the sliders.
